			answer: t(
				"Yes. Cutia is designed as a free, open-source, privacy-first alternative to CapCut. It offers AI-native editing, multi-track timeline, MP4/WebM export, and runs entirely in your browser — no account, no uploads, no watermarks.",
			),
		},
		{
			question: t("Does Cutia have the same features as CapCut?"),
			answer: t(
				"Cutia covers the core editing features most creators need: multi-track timeline, text and sticker overlays, AI image generation, audio transcription, and caption generation. CapCut offers additional advanced features like effects templates and more export formats, but Cutia is rapidly growing as an open-source project.",
			),
		},
		{
			question: t("Is Cutia really free with no watermarks?"),
			answer: t(
				"Yes. Cutia is 100% free with no premium tiers, no subscriptions, and no watermarks on exported videos. It is open-source software that you can use without any restrictions.",
			),
		},
		{
			question: t("Does CapCut upload my videos to servers?"),
			answer: t(
				"Yes. CapCut requires uploading your media files to remote servers for processing and storage. Cutia takes the opposite approach — all media processing happens locally in your browser and your files never leave your device.",
			),
		},
		{
			question: t("Can I use Cutia without creating an account?"),
			answer: t(
				"Yes. Cutia requires no sign-up or login. Just open the website and start editing immediately. Your projects are saved locally in your browser.",
			),
		},
		{
			question: t("Is Cutia open source?"),
			answer: t(
				"Yes. Cutia is fully open source and available on GitHub. You can inspect the code, contribute, fork it, or self-host it on your own server.",
			),
		},
		{
			question: t(
				"What AI features does Cutia offer compared to CapCut?",
			),
			answer: t(
				"Cutia is AI-native with a built-in AI agent that can edit videos from natural language prompts, AI image generation for creating visuals, and audio transcription for automatic caption generation. These features are integrated into the core editing workflow.",
			),
		},
		{
			question: t("Can I use Cutia on a Chromebook?"),
			answer: t(
				"Yes. Cutia runs entirely in your browser and works on any platform including Chromebooks, shared computers, and tablets — no installation or plugins required.",
			),
