			question: t("Does Cutia work offline?"),

		{
			question: t("How is Cutia different from CapCut?"),
			answer: t(
				"Unlike CapCut, Cutia is fully open source and runs entirely in your browser. Your media files stay on your device — only AI features may communicate with external services. Cutia is AI-native with built-in AI agent, image generation, and audio transcription, with no account or subscription required.",
